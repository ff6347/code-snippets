# Accelerate

## (AI generated) Description

This p5.js sketch demonstrates a simple motion acceleration effect. It visually represents an object accelerating across the canvas. Here's a concise summary of the outcome:

- Initializes with a black background.
- A small circle (ellipse) starts from the left edge of the canvas and accelerates towards the right.
- The acceleration increases exponentially, making the circle move faster over time.
- Once the circle moves off the right edge of the canvas, it resets to the left edge and starts accelerating again.

Key Features:

- Exponential acceleration of the circle.
- Automatic reset of the circle's position and acceleration upon reaching the canvas edge.
