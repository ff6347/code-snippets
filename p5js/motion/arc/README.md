# Arc Motion

## (AI generated) Description

This p5.js sketch creates a visual effect of circles moving along an arc path. It demonstrates the use of easing functions and trigonometric calculations to create smooth motion. Here's a concise summary of the outcome:

- Initializes with a white background.
- Draws circles that move along an arc path from left to right across the canvas.
- The vertical position of the circles oscillates based on a sine function, creating an arc motion effect.
- The horizontal position of the circles is adjusted using an easing function to create a smooth transition.
- Pressing the 's' key saves the current frame as a PNG image.

Key Features:

- Smooth arc motion using trigonometric functions.
- Easing function for smooth horizontal transitions.
- Key interaction to save the current frame as an image.
