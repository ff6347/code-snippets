# Connected Nodes

## (AI generated) Description

This p5.js sketch creates a dynamic visual representation of particles that move randomly and connect with lines when they are within a certain distance of each other. Here's a concise summary of the outcome:

- Initializes with a canvas of 500x500 pixels.
- Creates 300 particles with random initial positions and one particle highlighted in crimson.
- Each particle moves randomly based on Perlin noise and cosine functions.
- Particles wrap around the canvas edges to create a continuous motion effect.
- Draws lines between particles that are within a distance of 30 pixels from each other.
- Each frame, the background is slightly cleared to create a trailing effect.

Key Features:

- Randomized particle motion using Perlin noise.
- Dynamic line connections between nearby particles.
- Visual feedback with a highlighted particle.
