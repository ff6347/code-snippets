# Animate In

## (AI generated) Description

This p5.js sketch demonstrates an animation where a line moves and rotates with easing functions. Here's a concise summary of the outcome:

- Initializes with a canvas of size 500x500.
- Uses HSL color mode and sets up the canvas with specific drawing settings.
- The `draw` function continuously updates the line's position and rotation based on easing functions.
- The line's position and rotation are calculated using `easeInOutBounce` and `easeInExpo` functions.
- The line's stroke color and weight change dynamically based on the easing values.

Key Features:

- Smooth animation using easing functions.
- Dynamic visual changes in line position, rotation, color, and weight.
