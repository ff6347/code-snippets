# Dashed Line

## (AI generated) Description

This p5.js sketch demonstrates how to draw a dashed line using a loop. Here's a concise summary of the outcome:

- Initializes with a 100x100 canvas.
- Sets the background color to a medium gray.
- Translates the origin to the center of the canvas and rotates the coordinate system by 45 degrees.
- Draws a series of short vertical lines to create a dashed line effect:
  - Each dash is 5 pixels long with a 5-pixel gap between dashes.
  - The dashed line is centered horizontally on the canvas.
- Stops the draw loop after one iteration to keep the sketch static.

Key Features:

- Simple dashed line drawing using a loop.
- Coordinate system translation and rotation.
- Static sketch with no continuous drawing.
