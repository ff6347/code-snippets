# Random Grid

## (AI generated) Description

This p5.js sketch creates a 100 by 100 pixel canvas and fills it with randomly sized points, providing a textured appearance. The points are generated in a grid pattern, with each point spaced 5 pixels apart both horizontally and vertically.

- Canvas size: 100x100 pixels
- Background color: Grey (RGB value 128)
- Points pattern: Grid, 5 pixels apart
- Point size: Random, up to 5 pixels in stroke weight
- Additional feature: Pressing the 's' key saves the canvas as "multiples.png".

No animations or interactions are included beyond the ability to save the canvas with a key press.
